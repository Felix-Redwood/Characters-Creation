					<p>Behind every clocktower lies a humble inventor, who slaved for hours, cutting each gear into
						shape by hand. Tinkerers and creators lie behind every city, and their best work will define a
						nation for centuries.</p>
					<p>Artificers are something else. They infuse magic into their creations. Some become warriors,
						crafting their own firearms that shoot enchanted bullets. Others create flying companions that
						can conjure waves of fire onto enemies.</p>
					<p>Artificers can rival all other spellcasters, their intelligence and quick-thinking allowing them
						to find out of the box solutions to problems that others may find impossible. Unlike other magic
						classes, artificer’s use gadgets
						to cast their spells. For example, when casting fireball, you may be launching a fiery grenade
						from a launcher on your forearm. When casting a spell to help you understand a language, you
						might be placing a device in your ear
						that will translate all languages you hear.</p>
					<p>Due to this, artificers usually have the most creative ways of casting spells, and when you play
						one, you should think about how you might describe how your spells are casted. Here are some
						examples for you:</p>
					<ul type="disc">
						<li>Cure wounds: Applying a salve to a wound on the body</li>
						<li>Darkvision: Placing a pair of goggles over your eyes that allow you to see in the dark</li>
						<li>Fly: A pair of wings that burst from a backpack you’re carrying, or a pair of boots that
							rocket you into the air</li>
						<li>Water breathing: A tank of infinite air, attached to a mask you place over your face</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Artificers rely on intelligence to cast their ‘spells’, relying on a deep understanding of how
						their inventions work in order to perform feats that most would consider impossible. They also
						use dexterity to craft their complex
						creations. For this reason, races such as humans, gnomes and vedalken.</p>
					<p>This being said, artificers aren’t just inventors, rather they use their inventions to bolster
						their other abilities. They might be fighters, archivists or alchemists. For this reason, you
						can play a variety of races when being
						an artificer, and aren’t just restricted to those with a naturally high intelligence.</p>

					<p>Barbarians are one of the most powerful classes in D&D, in terms of raw strength and damage, and
						they’re feared by anyone who truly knows their might. The common idea of the barbarian is that
						they’re a dumb brute, destroying everything
						they see. While that may be true for some, barbarians vary greatly, and the smarter, wiser ones
						tend to be tribal chieftains, or soldiers on the frontlines of battle.</p>
					<p>As a barbarian, you won’t have to wear armour. Instead you can grit your teeth and absorb the
						attacks of your enemies. You also gain the ability to rage, increasing your strength for a short
						period of time as your vision turns
						red and the force of your strikes becomes enough to shake a castle. At later levels, your
						strength increases further, you gain the ability to just say “no” if you are killed (provided
						you roll a constitution saving throw),
						and when you score a critical hit, you get to add extra dice to your damage.</p>
					<p>There are a range of barbarians, from the simple berserker, who gain extra attacks from their
						frenzies, to more spiritual paths, such as the totem warrior, who worships an animal and gains
						features from them (such as the damage-resistance
						of a bear, the wings of an eagle, the speed of an elk) or the ancestral guardian, who can call
						forth their ancestors to aid them in a battle.</p>
					<p>Barbarians rely primarily on strength and constitution; if you take a more spiritual path then
						wisdom will come in handy as well. Races such as human, bugbear (a giant kind of goblin), orc,
						half-orc, dwarf, goliath (reclusive giant-kin
						from the mountains), minotaur (yes you can play a minotaur in D&D) or tortle (a humanoid turtle)
						all work well as barbarians.</p>

					<p>A common guard may have to fight, as may a bandit or a mercenary, but they are not true fighters.
						Fighters exist amongst criminals, knights and adventuring guilds, and show a natural drive
						towards combat, besting their enemies
						with ease. Fighters, although strong and quick, excel in all areas, such as tactics,
						negotiation, infiltration and leadership. A skilled fighter will rise quickly through the ranks
						of the toughest, most prestigious army.</p>
					<p>As a fighter, you gain multiple attacks, up to 4 per round at 20th level, allowing you to
						decimate your enemies before they’ve even drawn their weapons. You can also give yourself a
						surge of adrenaline, allowing you to attack even
						more for 1 round. Finally, you get more improvements to your ability scores than any other class
						does.</p>
					<p>There are a variety of paths you can go down as a fighter, from the champion, who scores up to 3
						times as many critical hits as any other class, to the cavalier, who fights atop their mount, to
						the eldritch knight, who imbues their
						attacks with magic, decapitating their enemy just before shooting an explosive fireball at the
						archers 60 feet away.</p>
					<p>A fighter’s best abilities are their constitution and strength; however you may choose to be an
						archer or gunslinger, in which case dexterity is going to be more important. Races best suited
						to be a fighter include; human, centaur,
						dragonborn, goliath, minotaur and warforged (robotic humans built from ancient times). That
						being said, fighter is such a varied class that it can be played by any race you wish.</p>

					<p>Understanding and controlling the natural energy, the ki that flows through us all, the monk can
						perform nigh-impossible feats with ease. A monk can take on four armed opponents with only their
						fists, they can live to 70 and still
						best a fully armoured foe, they can go up against a giant and still strike so hard that their
						foe is knocked onto their back.</p>
					<p>Monks take the path of discipline, of training every day, and learning how to gain mastery over
						ki, the force that flows through everything. Monks may have spent their lives in a secluded
						monastery, or might’ve been taught by a
						master and given relative freedom. They may have left their monastery for a variety of reasons;
						they might’ve been cast out or sent on an important mission.</p>
					<p>Monks can catch arrows in midair and throw them back at enemies (that’s an actual ability by the
						way). They can dash, reaching speeds upwards of 120 feet in one round, that’s 20 feet a second!
						While some use weapons, you also have
						the option of using your fists, which will eventually be tough enough to do the same damage as a
						warhammer!</p>
					<p>There are several paths a monk goes down. The way of the drunken fist relies on feinting your
						enemies, appearing much weaker than you are. The way of the four elements or the sun soul are
						more magical, and allow you to cast spells.
						There is also the way of the kensei, where you master a weapon, and use that, as a fighter
						might, against your enemies.</p>
					<p>Monks’ power comes from their dexterity and wisdom, and as such, races such as humans, aarakocra
						(humanoid birds who can fly), elves, halflings, kenku (half birds whose flight and voice was
						taken from them) and tabaxi (humanoid
						felines) will all make a good monk. That being said, you may choose to create a strength based
						monk if you desire.</p>

					<p>Unlike what is commonly thought, bards are not just musicians. They may be poets, playwrights or
						simply humble storytellers. A bard’s power comes from how they are able to enchant others, able
						to draw them in with their stories
						and songs. A good bard could persuade a king to have mercy on their greatest enemy, or convince
						a judge of 30 years of their innocence, despite being caught red handed. In the hands of a good
						person, the charm of a bard can
						save thousands, in the hands of bad people; it can turn the noblest knight to corruption and
						evil.</p>
					<p>Bards rarely take the violent path, either choosing to empower their allies, watching as their
						songs inspire fellow adventurers to push forth against even the most dangerous foes. While a
						barbarian or fighter may want to slay a
						dragon and capture its horde of gold, a bard will likely try to reason with it, or even to
						seduce it into submission, pocketing their share as the dragon turns away, shyly. </p>
					<p>Bards, unsurprisingly, are charisma based spellcasters, they rely on others being enthralled with
						the stories they tell, be it through words or through music. </p>
					<p>Races best suited to be bards include humans, aasimar, dragonborn, tieflings and tabaxi, although
						the ‘classic’ image of the bard is that of a gnome or halfling. </p>

					<p>Born of nature, one with nature, druids can feel the presence of nature from their skin to their
						bones. They’re blessed with abilities such as; talking to plants and animals, being able to
						spread life across desert, creating an
						oasis at will and being able to change into a beast of the forest.</p>
					<p>Picture this, it is the heat of battle, four elves stand at the end of a corridor, firing
						crossbows at you as you cower behind a flipped table. Suddenly, you notice a change in the
						usually timid gnome crouching next to you. Brown
						fur begins to sprout from their skin, their eyes darken and they grow in size. Before they know
						it, a bear is charging at the elves, their arrows bouncing off its leathery skin. It tears them
						to ribbons, before slowly turning
						back into that same timid gnome you thought you knew.</p>
					<p>Druids rely on wisdom, on their ability to know their instincts will guide them in the right

					<p>Rangers are generally seen as a mixture of a druid and a fighter. They have the ability to cast

						healing berries and teleport by entering
						a tree and coming out of another. </p>
					<p>Rangers also specialise, learning the complete information about certain types of terrain and
						enemies, gaining a significant advantage in fights against those chosen foes. There are many
						variants of ranger, such as the horizon
						crosser, who steps between the dimensions to confuse and terrify their enemies in battle, or the
						hunter, who marks an enemy and then drives them into the ground with targeted attacks and fiery,
						magical arrows. </p>
					<p>Rangers use their wisdom and dexterity to deliver hard hitting attacks laced with magical energy.

					<p>A blood hunter embraces evil and destruction, whether it is to destroy it, or to empower it. A
						blood hunter is a warrior like many others, but what sets them apart is their willingness to
						sacrifice their own vitality for the might
						it may grant them. </p>
					<p>As a blood hunter, you can enchant your weapons, dealing an array of damage types ranging from
						fire to psychic, in exchange for taking some damage. Additionally, you learn a handful of ‘blood
						curses’, which you can inflict on enemies.
						These curses can be amplified, where they will produce a more powerful result in exchange for
						you taking damage. Some notable blood curses include: </p>
					<ul type="disc">
						<li>Blood curse of the eyeless – blind your enemies so that they have trouble attacking you</li>
						<li>Blood curse of binding – stop your foes in their tracks, rooting them into the ground so
							they can’t run from you</li>
						<li>Blood curse of mutual suffering – force a combatant to share all pain they inflict upon you
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Blood hunter is one of the most varied classes and can be somewhat complex when playing. If you
						wish to amplify your curses you may wish to have a high constitution, so that you can bear the
						damage you will do to yourself. If you
						wish to focus on spell casting then you may wish to increase wisdom and if you want to empower
						your fighting abilities you may wish to focus on dexterity or strength, depending on whether you
						desire to be a ranged or melee
						fighter. </p>
					<p>For this reason, almost any race works well with the blood hunter class; however humans, firbolg,
						loxodon and kalashtar (half-dream people) work especially well due to their natural abilities.
						As blood hunter is not an ‘official’
						class, always consult with your dungeon master before choosing to play it. </p>

				<div class="description-text">
					<p>Unlike a cleric, who worships a deity, a warlock forms a ‘pact’ with a powerful being, their
						patron, who bestows them with magic. The relationship between a warlock and their patron can
						vary; it could be like that of an eager apprentice
						and a wise master, or that of a slave and their owner. </p>
					<p>Pacts are entered into for a variety of reasons; your warlock could’ve been born into a family of
						magic users unable to make any magic of their own, causing them to seek a patron who would grant
						them the magic they needed for their
						family’s acceptance. You might’ve been lost at sea, stuck on a piece of driftwood slowly being
						sucked into a whirlpool, and had a voice speak out to you “give me your soul, and I’ll save you
						from this”. </p>
					<p>Depending on the pact, warlocks can vary from frontline soldiers who summon their weapons into
						their hands from seemingly nowhere, to spellcasters whose pacts with fiendish devils allow them
						to hurl their enemies through a hellscape,
						killing them by overloading their minds with horrific, incomprehensible imagery (yes that’s a
						real ability at level 14). </p>
					<p>Having to bargain with their patron means that charisma is the main ability of the warlock. For
						this reason, races such as human, aasimar, dragonborn, tieflings and changelings (pale humanoids
						who can disguise themselves at will)
						are the most suited for playing a warlock. </p>
					<p>However, races such as elf, dwarf and genasi (creatures born of air, earth, fire or water) can be
						interesting to play as a combat-focused warlock, as their other abilities, such as improved
						constitution and dexterity, may serve
						better when fighting on the front lines. </p>

					<p>A simple oath, a small list of principles to be guided by. Anybody can follow this path, but for
						a paladin, this path is their life. A paladin is not just guided by the oath they take, they are
						defined by it. </p>
					<p>A paladin is a warrior who swears to uphold a set of principles, an oath. This could be an oath
						of devotion, binding the paladin to the ideals of justice, virtue and prosperity, or an oath of
						redemption, motivating you to save
						all you can, and turn those who are evil into virtuous, productive members of the societies they
						live in. </p>
					<p>Not all paladins are good, however. Some take an oath of vengeance, seeking to find those who
						have slighted them in even the smallest way, and destroy their livelihoods, kill their families
						and burn their lands. Those who take
						an oath of vengeance are to be avoided, and never to be wronged. </p>
					<p>Others still may take an oath of conquest, believing that might is the guiding power of the
						world, and that the weak must be struck down to make way for the strong. Some paladins take an
						oath of the crown, becoming soldiers for
						their kingdom, and guiding armies night and day. </p>
					<p>Paladins rely on strength and charisma. As a fighter, it is important for the paladin to be able
						to swing a sword hundreds of times in just one battle, however they must also have the presence
						and confidence to lead and inspire
						others to fight against whatever force threatens their oath. </p>
					<p>Paladins can really be played by any race, as they are very versatile classes, however some of

						humanoids who guard the ocean depths) and
						half-elves. </p>

					<p>Mortal beings can become more powerful than you might think, but some situations call for divine

					<p>Clerics act as conduits for the power of the gods, channelling their might and manifesting it in
						ways that most people would call impossible. This isn’t granted to everyone, only devoted
						followers who have a higher calling, a destiny
						they must fulfil. </p>
					<p>Unlike wizards and sorcerers, clerics are not just spellcasters, but holy warriors too, who may
						at times depend on being on the frontlines to best utilise their magic. </p>
					<p>Just as wizards have different schools and sorcerers have different bloodlines, so do clerics
						have a variety of deities they worship, varying from the grave domain, who guide spirits on the
						journey from life to death, to the war
						domain, whose followers act as soldiers, embalming their swords with radiant power to cut down
						even the most powerful foe. There are more tame variants of clerics, however, such as the
						knowledge domain, which seeks to empower
						the ideals of invention, tinkering and understanding. </p>
					<p>No matter what domain you choose, a cleric is an awesome sight on a battlefield. They may revive
						a freshly dead enemy, right before turning around and sending a ray of searing light right into
						the killer. </p>
					<p>Clerics rely on wisdom to cast their spells. They must be in touch with the wishes of their
						deity, so their intuition is most important to them. </p>
					<p>For this reason, the races best suited to be clerics include; human, aarakocra (birdlike people

					<p>Will you be a conjurer, who can summon demons onto the battlefield to fight for you? Perhaps a
						transmuter, who can double their size at will, and throw boulders at their enemies before
						shrinking to the size of a squirrel to infiltrate
						a castle? Maybe even a necromancer who, with a swift flick of their hand, causes a whole army of
						enemies to wither to nothing. </p>
					<p>The possibilities for playing a wizard are endless, and the power you gain can be used for good
						or evil. At some point in your games you will have to make the choice; do you want to save the
						world, or rule it? </p>
					<p>Wizards use intelligence to power their spells. They study day in and day out, learning the
						verbal and material components of the spells that they cast. </p>
					<p>As such, wizards are most suited for those races that tend to be the sages, engineers or
						tinkerers. Races best suited for a wizard include; humans, gnomes, vedalken (partially
						amphibious humanoids from the oceans) or tieflings
						(humans whose bloodlines include the genes of devils). </p>

					<p>A good rogue is never seen, whether that means they skulk in the shadows or hide in plain sight,
						that is up to them. They range from simple thieves to cunning assassins, scouring a 50 foot high
						wall to slink into the king’s chamber
						through the window, administering one drop of deadly venom into the king’s open, snoring mouth,
						and then exiting the way they came. </p>
					<p>As a rogue, you have lots of options of how you wish to play your character. You could be the
						deceiver, who manipulates politics from behind the scenes to gain access to the most powerful
						people, or the arcane trickster, pick pocketing
						from nobles using a floating, magic hand, while you sit comfortably 50 feet away. </p>
					<p>Rogues are able to sneak attack which, when used at the beginning of battle or during an ambush,
						can mean that they deal more damage than a barbarian. They also gain an improved dodge, meaning
						that they have the ability to take
						no damage from a fireball thrown at them. </p>
					<p>There are various archetypes to choose from. There are the assassins and the thieves, who are
						best when they aren’t seen or heard, and prefer one swift blow to a drawn out battle. There is
						the arcane trickster, who can use their
						magic to aid in being unnoticed, even gaining a magical invisible hand that can fly about and
						manipulate objects for them. Finally, there is the inquisitive, who excels at discovering
						secrets and mystery. </p>
					<p>Rogues all use dexterity, but depending on whether you plan to manipulate people or to be hidden,
						you will either want to choose charisma or intelligence. Races best for rogue include; human,
						elves, aaracokra, halflings and tabaxi.</p>
