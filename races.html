					<p>The kalashtar are humans who have been touched by the plane of dreams. They have a connection to
						a spirit of the dream world, whose memories they draw from when they sleep (instead of
						dreaming). A kalashtar cannot connect directly
						with their spirit (called a ‘quori’), instead relying on instincts to guide them. </p>
					<p>The kalashtar are thought of as wise beings, and are able to telepathically communicate up to a
						distance of 60 feet, as well as being resistant to psychic damage. They stand a few inches
						taller than the average human and have slightly
						more angular features. </p>
					<p>Due to their boosts to wisdom and charisma, as well as their psychic powers, a kalashtar makes a
						great cleric, warlock or paladin, although the variance of the race means that it is easy to
						play any class with it. </p>
